Are you ready for "The Bard Song"?
I said are you ready for "The Bard Song"?
Then let's sing "The Bard Song, In the Forest"

Now you all know the bards and their songs
When hours have gone by, I'll close my eyes
In a world far away we may meet again
But now hear my song about the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bard's song

Tomorrow will take us away far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away the fear of today
It will be gone due to our magic songs
